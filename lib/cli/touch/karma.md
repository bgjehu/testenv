# Karma Config File



## Create the config file
```
testenv touch <new-config-file-0> <new-config-file-1> <...> -k
```

upon creating the files, you will be ask to choose options for
* Are you using React JS in your source code? (if yes,  [browserify](http://browserify.org/) framework would be added in the config file, but you have to manually specify what files you want to browserify in ```preprocessors```)
* Do you want code coverage to be shown? (if yes, [karma-coverage](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage) and [browserify-istanbul](https://github.com/devongovett/browserify-istanbul) would be added)
* Do you want code coverage report in HTML  (if yes, html would be added in reporters of karma-coverage)



## Configs that you may want to change



### basePath

```basePath``` is used to resolved your ```files``` and ```exclude```, and it was resolved based on where your config file is.



### frameworks

```frameworks``` would be generated by ```testenv touch``` based on the options your put in, but if your karma test use any other frameworks, feel free to put in more. Just make sure your know what your are doing. [More details](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/configuration-file.html).



### files
Your definitely want do put in your file paths or patterns in ```files``` for it was empty from ```testenv touch```.

Example:
```
files: [
    'src/**/**.js',
    'test/**/*.js'
],
```



### exclude

```exclude``` is basically the same thing with ```files```, except it excludes the files.



### preprocessors

if you are using things like ReactJS, Sass, less and etc, you may want to add them in ```preprocessors```. [More details](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/preprocessors.html)



### browsers
```['PhantomJS', 'Firefox', 'Chrome']``` is default from ```testenv touch```. You may want to change it.
